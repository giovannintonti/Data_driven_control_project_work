This folder contains the videos of the experiments deployed to the Robotarium platform. The experiments are named as follows:
- 'robotarium-baseline-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the baseline cost.
- 'robotarium-proposed-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the proposed cost.
- 'robotarium-baseline-ioc-with-baseline-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the baseline cost reconstructed with the baseline features.
- 'robotarium-baseline-ioc-with-proposed-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the proposed cost reconstructed with the baseline features.
- 'robotarium-proposed-ioc-with-baseline-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the baseline cost reconstructed with the proposed features.
- 'robotarium-proposed-ioc-with-proposed-foc.mp4': This a deployment of the policy obtained with the proposed cost reconstructed with the proposed features.
- 'robotarium-obstacle-recognition.mp4': This video is for understanding the size of the obstacles.
